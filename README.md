# SeaBattle
A battleship game for the terminal in Python 3 and unicurses. The game is in early development still, you can test setting ships by running:
```python3 set_ships.py```
The game was tested under linux but should run on Mac and Windows as well, but I'll work on that in the future!

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or newer
- [unicurses 1.2](https://github.com/Chiel92/unicurses) or newer (```pip3 install unicurses``` does the trick)

Any suggestions, tips, requests etc. are hightly appreciated.
